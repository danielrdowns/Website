A friend recently asked why I chose now to establish a personal website for cataloging my thoughts and productions. 

It would be tough to deny that this is a challenging time to launch a new project. 

I believe that building now is more important than ever. 

Regardless of whether you're launching a business, developing a novel product, crafting an innovatiive art project, or inaururating some other endeavor, it is essential that we build. 

At this time, humanity as a species has temporarily had stripped away the facade that we have omnipotent dominion on Earth.

We are reminded of our mortality and our fragility.

We are reminded of the unforgiving nature of the Universe that characterizes existence. 

This is good. Homo sapiens did not rise to dominion of Earth without adversity. 

At this time we should take stock, figure out where we should go from here, decide a course of action, and then execute. 

As individuals and organizations, the choice is ours for what we want to see in a post-crisis world. 

Now is the time to roll up our shirtsleeves and get to work.
